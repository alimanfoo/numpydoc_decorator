# numpydoc_decorator

This package allows you to build numpy-style docstrings
programmatically and apply them using a decorator. This can be useful
because:

* Parts of your documentation, such as parameter descriptions, can be
  shared between functions, avoiding the need to repeat yourself.

* Type information for parameters and return values is automatically
  picked up from type annotations and added to the docstring, avoiding
  the need to maintain type information in two places.

Work in progress.
